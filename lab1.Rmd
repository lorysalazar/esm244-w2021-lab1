### Read in SF trees data

```{r}
sf_trees <- read.csv(here("data", "sf_trees", "sf_trees.csv"))
```


### Basic wrangling reminders

Find the top 5 highest observations of trees by legal_status, do some wrangling, make a graph.

```{r}
top_5_status <- sf_trees %>% 
  count(legal_status) %>% # recall this counts observation based on variables; combines group_by, summarize, and n
  drop_na(legal_status) %>% 
  rename(tree_count = n) %>% 
  relocate(tree_count) %>% # moves tree_count to the first column
  slice_max(tree_count, n = 5) # takes top 5 of tree_count
```
